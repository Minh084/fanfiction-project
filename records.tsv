The moon was bright and full, illuminating the couple as they enjoyed each other's company. 'See?  I told you we'd get our vacation on Delfino Island eventually,' Luigi said to his companion.   Waluigi said nothing, instead losing himself in his thoughts.  He had been oddly quiet during the walk, and Luigi was beginning to wonder why.  'Something on your mind, Waluigi?'  Waluigi stopped and turned to face Luigi.  'No, it's nothing.  Well, it's just...what are you doing with me, Luigi?  I'm not a hero like you, quite the opposite in fact.  Up until recently all I did was steal treasure with Wario.' Luigi reached up and cupped Waluigi's cheek with his hand.  'You are so much more than a thief.  I hope you know that.  You're sweet and kind, and one hell of a kisser.'   Waluigi laughed and pulled Luigi into his arms.  Somehow Luigi always knew what to say.

There's blood soaking into the ground,  Turning dirt into thick, filmy mud.  Once glistening blades have dulled with rust,  Forever lost from their masters hands.  Creatures move through the shadows,  and light that once shone through any darkness  grows weak as the war around me rages.  There are no bodies among the rubble,  though the howling winds are heavy with upturned dust  and charged with electricity.  Walls are scorched and dripping,  chunks missing along the gashes  in the marble and stone.  We are separated, but hope never dies.  Our hearts and minds beat as one.  This battle has gone on for far too long.  It will end with us.  We are the light that will shine through the darkness.

There's Kryptonite, the one substance that could render Kara powerless, strip her of her strength, the one thing she prized so greatly. The green, whilst it looked bright, she associated with fearful, painful days spent in the DEO medbay, feeling empty- as if every fibre of her being had been drained from her. Heavy limbs, heavy head,  a fog so thick she couldn't function, sinking lower and lower and lower… Only to be pulled out of this spiral by the same colour which plunged her down into it. Bright green eyes, like jade, but somehow more pure and wild.

The day the music ended, was the day Rogue had put his hand through Sting's stomach, as dragons destroyed the world around them.  Sting had smiled at him, his half transformation into a dragon fading, and he'd thanked Rogue even as he'd bled out.  Thanked him for saving his soul.  As Sting died in his arms, so too did the music in Rogue's heart.  Replaced only by a soundless void, that ached for the bright melody it had once known.  And he resolved, in that moment, to do whatever was necessary to bring it back, to undo all that had befallen them.  Even if it meant sacrificing everything else.
